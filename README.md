Make sure the viewing of hidden files is enabled, you will need to look inside your C:/users/ folder.

Go to Control Panel In the Search box, type Folder Click "Folder Options" Click the tab that says View Make sure there is no check in the box for "Hide file extensions for known file types" (de-select this option and click OK) Exit Control Panel

You will see appdata as a hidden folder, open it up and then open the roaming folder and paste the MaryJaneCoin folder there.

After pasting the folder run the qt from the other folder titled "maryjanecoin-qt", if it doesn't load the first time run the qt one more time and it should work.
